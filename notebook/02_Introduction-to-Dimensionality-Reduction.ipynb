Dimensionality reduction helps to reduce the number of features while retaining key information. Techniques like __principal component analysis (PCA)__, __singular value decomposition (SVD)__ and __linear discriminant analysis (LDA)__ convert data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important details.\n",
