    "Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data. It is performed during the data pre-processing to handle highly varying values. If feature scaling is not done then __machine learning algorithm tends to use greater values as higher and consider smaller values as lower regardless of the unit of the values__. For example it will take 10 m and 10 cm both as same regardless of their unit. In this article we will learn about different techniques which are used to perform feature scaling.\n",
